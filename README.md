# Introduction 

My love for reading inspired me to create the My Book List application. Having an app that allows you to keep track of what books you are reading, completed and want to read helps keep you motivated and gives you the ability to see your achievements. The main goal of this project was to design and build an application that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the application is mainly built using HTML, CSS, Python and Flask. 

The application is only made up of a singular page which includes the following:
  - My Book List logo
  - Background image of books on a bookshelf
  - A form which allows users to input information like:
      * Book Title 
      * Author
      * Comments
      * Status - Reading, Completed and Want to Read
  - Delete and Edit button where they can erase or make any changes.

## Target Audience

The My Book List app targets all individuals who love reading books and want to keep track of books they want to read, complete and are currently reading. 

## Business Goals

The business goals of the application are:

1. Provide users with a simple application that doesn't require many buttons or moving from one page to another.
2. Make the application accessible for all devices.
3. Allows users to add, edit and delete books in their list.
4. Create a community for individuals who love reading.

## User Goals

The user goals of the application are: 

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily ass, edit and delete books I have added to my list.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to have the option to mark my books as either completed, reading or want to read, and then update it.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want the application to be easy to understand and use.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want the application to be available on all devices.

# UX

## Strategy 

When thinking of the app's strategy, I considered who the target audience is and what features the users would be looking for in a book list app. For the target audience, my main focus was the book community since the app will be more relevant to them. Finally, for the features users would be looking for I want to add a form which allows users to add their books by inputting book titles, authors, comments and status. When users have completed and submitted the form, the information will appear under the form with a delete button and an edit button. 

## Scope 

To accomplish the business goals and the user goals the features I will be adding in this release are the following:

1. Form - This will allow users to input information about their book (Book Title, Author, Comments, and Status).
2. Delete Button - This will allow users to delete existing books.
3. Edit Button - This will allow users to edit book information.

### Future planned releases:

1. Sign Up/ Login Page - This feature will allow users to create an account and log in on different devices. It will also allow any information to stay on their account unless it's deleted.
2. Nav Bar - This feature will separate the statuses of books (All, Reading, Completed, Want to Read)
3. Stars - Within the form, I will add a stars field to the form which allows users to rate the book they've read. With the addition of the existing edit button, they can change their rating.
4. Date Started and Finished - This feature will also be added to the form, this will allow users to input the date they started reading and when they finished reading the book.

## Structure

During the planning for the structure of the application, I will be referring back to the User Goals to accomplish their expectations of the app. Looking at the third user goal ("As a first-time visitor, I want the application to be easy to understand and use") the app must be easy to use and understand, for this goal, I will be building the application on a singular page with a simple layout. The page will be structured with the logo at the top of the page, under the logo will be the book form and finally under the form will be the list of books the user has added. Finally, for the fourth user goal ("As a first-time visitor, U want the application to be available on all devices") I will be making sure the application will be available on all devices, to do this I will be using Google Dev tools to test the responsiveness of the application when viewing it on different devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop.
