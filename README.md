# Introduction 

My love for reading inspired me to create the My Book List application. Having an app that allows you to keep track of what books you are reading, completed and want to read helps keep you motivated and the ability to see your achievments. The main goal of this project was to design and built an application that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the application is mainly bult using HTML, CSS, Python and Flask. 

The application is only made up of a singluar page which includes:
  - My Book List logo
  - Background image of books on a bookshelf
  - A form which allows users to input information like:
      * Book Title 
      * Author
      * Comments
      * Status - Reading, Completed and Want to Read
      * Stars - 1-5
  - Delete and Edit button where they can erase or make any changes.
