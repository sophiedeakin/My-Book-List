# Introduction 

Welcome to My Book List, your go-to website for tracking books you are reading, completed and want to read in the future. This simple website helps you stay organised and motivates you to read more books or achieve personal goals.

# UX

## Strategy

### Target Audience 

For the target audience, my main focus was the book community who have a passion for reading and books. After researching other book review/tracking websites like Goodreads I found the average age range for users is 18-34 years old. My other focuses are readers who lead a busy lifestyle and want to keep track of their reading progress that fits into their schedule, and book collectors who want to organise and catalogue their book collections.

### Business Goals

The business goals for My Book List are:

1. Create a Reliable Product
   - Provide users with a seamless experience.
   - Listening and acting on user feedback by fixing any bugs or errors.
   - Push out stable updates and provide users with patch notes.

2. Feature Development
   - Implement a feedback form and signup/login form.
   - Improve the look of current features.
   - Introduce discussion forums for users to interact with each other.
  
3. User Experience (UX) and Interface (UI) Improvements:
   - Conduct user research to identify areas of improvement in the website design and functionality.
   - Optimise the app for different devices and screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience.

4. Data Security and Privacy
   - Comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR to ensure transparency and user control over their data.
  
### User Goals 

The user goals of My Book List are:

1. Organising Reading Lists
   - Users will want a website that will allow them to create and manage reading lists to keep track of books they are reading, completed and want to read in the future.

2. Tracking Reading Progress
   - Users will want a website that tracks progress as they read books. The website should provide features for updating reading progress and displaying it visually.

3. Reliable Performance and Easy Navigation
   - Users expect the website to load quickly and respond promptly to their interactions, without experiencing slowdowns, errors, or downtime.
   - Users want to navigate the website easily and intuitively, finding what they're looking for without getting lost or confused.

4. Compatibility and Mobile Responsiveness
   - Users want the website to work seamlessly across different web browsers, operating systems, and internet connections, ensuring a consistent  user experience.
   - Users want the website responsive and functional on various devices and screen sizes, including smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.

## Scope

To accomplish the business and user goals the features that will be added in the first release of My Book List are: 

1. Logo
   - The logo will be located at the top of the website, designed and edited using Canva and a background removal tool. In addition, since the logo I have picked will have light colours I will be making the header a dark colour and changing the opacity so users can still see the background image.
  
2. Background Image
   - For the background, I will be choosing an image of books on bookshelves to make the website athletically pleasing then have a plain background colour.

3. Book Form
   - For My Book List I will be designing and building a form which will allow users to add new books, the form will consist of the following fields:
     - Book Title
     - Author
     - Comments - Any comments users wish to make about the book or reminders of what chapter/page they are on.
     - Status - Allow users to write in their current status of the book such as Reading, Completed and Want To Read. This field will be set as text to allow users more flexibility with how they want to set their status.
     - "Add Book" Button - When users click on this button it will submit their book data and will be displayed visually in the table. Additionally, when users submit book data the information will be saved to a database which will save their data and retrieve it when returning to the website.

4. Book Table
   - When users submit their book information it will be shown in a table nder the correct table heading and allow multiple row to be added. I will also be adding an extra column called "Actions", this will have the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

5. Edit Button
   - This interactive feature will allow users to edit their current books by opening up the form and display the book information, users will then make any changes they want and click on the "Save" button, this will automatically redirect them back to the Home page and show the updates they've made.

6. Delete Button
   - This interactive feature will allow users to delete any books in the table.

### Future Planned Releases 

In the future I have planned to release the following features:

1. Sign Up / Login Page
  - This feature will allow users to create an account and login on different devices, it will also allow any information to stay on their account unless the user decides to delete it.

2. Account Customisation

3. Table Filter

4. Date Started and Finished
   - This feature will be added to the form to allow users to input what day they started reading their book and when they finished it. This feature will be suitable to users who like to keep track on how long it takes them to read a book.

5. Stars
